Description: This package does several things to support analysis for the Mountain Rain or Snow citizen science project. 1) It accesses meteorological data from several networks. 2) It models meteorological data for each rain-snow-mixed observation. 3) It quality controls the citizen science data. 4) It will probably do more things, but 1-4 are most important.
